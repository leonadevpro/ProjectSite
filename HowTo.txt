If creating a new repositor:
    git init
    git add <file_name> || Adds a changed file to the "cache" to be pushed.
    >>what does "git branch -M main" do?
    git remote add origin <url> || Adds the source of a project (e.g. the location on the github website) [https://github.com/leonadevpro/ProjectSite.git]
    git push -u origin main || adds the changes to repo

Updating a repo:
    git add <file_name> || Adds a changed file to be pushed.
    git push -u origin main 

Questions:
    How does git CLI have necessary information for where to push the changes to?
        Stored in hidden .git file. Will contain repo location and relevant changes.

    What do additions to "push" change? (e.g. -u origin main)
        I *think* this makes the commit the most recent "upstream" change. If it were forked by someone else they would be downloaded the "upstream" change.
        Check git push --help for more info.
